        <p>
          Although there are many positive impacts of technology in the watch
          industry, the negative impacts cannot be neglected. There are also a few
          challenges and negative impacts of technology in the watch industry. The
          challenges include effects on traditional craftsmanship, customer behavior,
          and environmental effects.

        <!-- Section 1: Over-Reliance on Technology and Reduced Longevity -->
        <h3>1. Over-Reliance on Technology and Reduced Longevity</h3>
        <p>
          Many smartwatches have a shorter lifespan than traditional mechanically
          powered watches due to their reliance on batteries and electronic
          components, which can be damaged or stop working after some time. So,
          smartwatches need to be replaced once in a while. The battery needs to be
          replaced frequently.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2: Environmental Impact -->
        <h3>2. Environmental Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Smartwatch and digital watch industries can produce huge amounts of
          electronic waste, which is a very serious and huge problem. Unlike
          mechanical watches, which last for decades, digital watch parts get
          damaged frequently and need to be replaced with new ones. However, the old
          parts cannot be recycled, so they end up as waste, which seriously impacts
          nature and the environment by releasing different chemicals from the
          batteries or other semiconductors.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 3: Privacy and Security Concerns -->
        <h3>3. Privacy and Security Concerns</h3>
        <p>
          Many smartwatches require users to accept privacy policy agreements that
          are often accepted without reading. Smartwatches collect personal data,
          including health information, live location, and may even have access to
          call records. This raises questions about data privacy and the potential
          for misuse of collected data. Users may not always be aware of the data
          being collected and how it is manipulated.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 4: Loss of Traditional Craftsmanship -->
        <h3>4. Loss of Traditional Craftsmanship</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the rise of mass production of smartwatches in the industry, the
          demand for traditional mechanical watches has declined. Mechanical
          watchmaking is a highly skilled and honored craft that has been practiced
          for centuries. Digital and quartz watches require less expertise to
          assemble and have overtaken the market, overshadowing the traditional and
          highly delicate craft of mechanical watchmaking.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 5: Watch Pricing -->
        <h3>5. Watch Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years, there has been significant fluctuation in the price of
          watches. Traditional mechanical watches were affordable with very minimal
          features, so the price was set according to the features provided. However,
          todayâ€™s modern smartwatches are equipped with high-end technologies, which
          are expensive. Adding these features is the main reason behind the high
          price of watches. Most watch companies set high prices for their watches
          simply because their brand name is popular. Popular watch brands like
          Rolex and Fossil make their watches very expensive, which cannot be
          afforded by everyone.

        <!-- Conclusion Section -->
        <p>
          <b>Conclusion:</b>
          In conclusion, the adaptation of technology in watchmaking and smart
          technology might impact the overall tradition and legacy of watchmaking.
          The overuse of smartwatches and high-end technology might significantly
          decline the demand for traditional mechanical and classic watches. Although
          post-sales services for watches are more efficient due to technology, the
          watchmakers collect delicate data about customers' watches and their
          details, which is very serious if misused.
