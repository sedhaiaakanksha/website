        Despite having numerous reasons to adapt cutting-edge technology in watchmaking, there are also some considerable reasons that are harming people’s lives due to the overuse of technology in watchmaking. Environmental impact is one of the major problems that the world is facing, and what’s making it worse is the waste products and residue data produced from the watch industry, which may be toxic in nature, such as lead and carbon. These cause serious environmental hazards if not disposed of properly. Because of these, humans may have to face serious consequences.
