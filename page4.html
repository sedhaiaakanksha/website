            <!-- Introduction paragraph -->
            <p>
                With the help of the internet, people all over the world can learn about different types of watches and can buy according to their needs and desires with the help of platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, etc. This makes sales not only in a particular country but all around the globe. Also, it's easier for the marketing of watches since social media influencers have a huge number of followers, which allows watches to reach a huge audience. As people are blind fans of influencers, if influencers themselves wear the watch, it motivates fans to buy the watch and spread the word among their friends. Additionally, if the bought watch has some problems or users may not know how to use it, customers can visit the website and put their queries in an AI-powered chatbot, which is available 24/7. This increases customer satisfaction and encourages them to buy again through the same website.

                Similarly, large design blueprints, extensive legal documents, and complex transaction records, which are integral to the luxury watch field and often consist of PDFs with thousands of pages, can easily be compressed into smaller sizes without losing quality. By gathering big data and performing analysis, brands can gain valuable insights into the predictive behavior of customers, understand what drives purchases, and anticipate demand. This helps in managing inventory issues, avoiding overproduction, reducing waste, and enabling better supply chain management. These efficiencies result in significant cost savings for the brand.
